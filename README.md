## Data Collection
To analyze the 2023/2024 season of Europe’s top five football leagues, I sourced extensive and precise data from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). These platforms provided comprehensive match details, player performances, team dynamics, team's managers and their respective stadium. The data collection involved thorough gathering, cross-referencing, cleaning, and validation to ensure accuracy and consistency. This robust dataset enabled a deep dive into the season's intricacies, uncovering fascinating insights and trends that vividly capture the excitement and drama of top-tier football.

## Data Preparation
Transforming raw data into valuable insights began with meticulous preparation. Utilizing Microsoft Excel, I reshaped the data into organized structures before importing it into Power BI for visualization. This process involved:
- **Cleaning**: Eliminating duplicates and blanks, addressing missing values, and ensuring data is presented in a table format.
- **Ensuring Integrity**: Removing blank rows and duplicates using the filter function. Cross-checking data with the official competition's official websites helped correct any discrepancies such as swapped team names or missing scoreline.
- **Aggregation**: Compiling statistics at various levels, such as team and competition metrics, for easy analysis.

## Data Visualization
Unlocking the story within the data required compelling visuals. I harnessed Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard, making the data engaging and accessible. This dashboard enabled viewers to dive into various aspects, revealing team performances, competition analysis, significant season highlights, and comparisons between teams.
